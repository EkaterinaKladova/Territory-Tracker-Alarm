Once turned on, the app checks the [Wynncraft API](https://docs.wynncraft.com/docs/)* every 2 minutes for which guild owns the territories listed.  If any of the territories do not belong to the Empire of Sindria (ESI), it rings an alarm, which can be turned off by clicking the toggle button in the app.  It was once used to detect attacks on ESI territories and lowered the response time from hours to minutes.

*The API endpoint used in the app is outdated, but since this app is no longer in use, it will not be updated anytime soon (or ever).
